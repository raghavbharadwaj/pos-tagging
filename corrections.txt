The following corrections have been made after discussing with Professor in Part-1 of Assignment -3. The changes have been made to make perceplearn.py and percepclassify.py to work as a generic classifier comparable with off the shelf tools like megam perceptron.

Added new folder part-1-corrections and added two files perceplearn.py and percepclassify.py
	root/
	    part-1-corrections/
		              perceplearn.py
			      percepclassify.py  		 	
Format to run the programs:

1) python3 perceplearn.py ARG1 MODELFILE

-where ARG1 is the feature extracted input file in the form (LABEL FEATURE1 FEATURE2...FEATURE_N )

2) python3 percepclassify.py MODELFILE <testfile>outputfile

-where test file is the feature extracted output file in the form ( FEATURE1 fEATURE2...FEATURE_N )
